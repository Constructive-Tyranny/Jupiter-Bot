Original ReadMe.txt, needs to be updated:
```
The command line for this application is as follows:
Bot.exe [-config Config.ini] [-pluginsdir Plugins\]

There are also many configuration options in the Config
file. Please read through these to get an idea of what
exactly you can actually configure the bot to do. If you
understand how to configure this bot, you can potentially
reduce all of your IRC bots down to a single instance.

Also: Take note that whenever the bot syncs the config
from memory to the file (such as when adding a setjoin),
all comments in the file are destroyed.
